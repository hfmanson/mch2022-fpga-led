Demonstrates the use of the FPGA RGB led by a ESP32 MicroPython program.
Uses FPGA bitstream [spi_skeleton.bin](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/spi_skeleton) and  
Python [FPGAWB](https://github.com/badgeteam/badgePython/blob/master/python_modules/mch2022/fpga_wishbone.py) class

fpga_led.py is a Python implementation of [https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/projects/selftest/fw/led.c](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/projects/selftest/fw/led.c)
